# How to Secure Your Connections with TheGreenBow IPsec VPN Client 5.5
 
VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that allows you to create a secure and encrypted connection over a public network, such as the Internet. VPNs are widely used by organizations and individuals to protect their data and privacy, as well as to access remote resources and services.

One of the most popular and reliable VPN protocols is IPsec (Internet Protocol Security), which provides authentication, encryption and integrity for the data packets exchanged between two or more devices. IPsec can operate in two modes: tunnel mode and transport mode. In tunnel mode, the entire IP packet is encrypted and encapsulated in a new IP packet, creating a virtual tunnel between the endpoints. In transport mode, only the payload of the IP packet is encrypted, leaving the original IP header intact.
 
To use IPsec VPN, you need a VPN client software that can establish and manage the VPN connections.
